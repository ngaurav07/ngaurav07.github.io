</p>


- Developed and deployed Backend APIs within the AWS environment for a real-time trading application that enabled users to trade online securely, utilizing Java, Spring, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL for high-performance RESTful services and payment gateway integration.
- Worked closely with AI developers to develop and deploy AI models for background removal and OCR-based citizenship information extraction, seamlessly integrating the solutions into a Java-based backend application.
- Utilized AWS Lambda to generate multiple versions of images, reducing latency by 30% and optimizing image size before sending them to the front end, resulting in faster load times and improved performance.
- Implemented Kafka to replace synchronous communication, enabling asynchronous image processing. 
This approach improved user experience by allowing faster interactions, with OCR results sent to the 
frontend once processing is complete.
